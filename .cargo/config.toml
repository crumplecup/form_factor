# Note: Environment variables for build scripts must be set in your shell
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
#   export LIBCLANG_PATH=/usr/lib
#   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib
#
# Or build with:
#   LIBCLANG_PATH=/usr/lib LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib cargo build --release

[env]
# These apply to the final binary, not build scripts
LIBCLANG_PATH = "/usr/lib"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "/usr/lib"
