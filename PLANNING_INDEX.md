# Planning Document Index

This document provides a comprehensive index of all planning and strategy documents in the Form Factor workspace, organized by category with their last commit information.

## About This Index

This index tracks all planning documents in the workspace. When documents are completed or superseded, they are **deleted from the workspace** but remain accessible in git history. The index preserves entries for deleted documents with their last commit hash, allowing easy retrieval via `git show <commit>:<path>`.

**To view a deleted document**: `git show <commit-hash>:<document-path>`
